# VBA-challenge

My code was created by many google searches, class reviews and youtube video's. I added some of my own ideas and touches, aka
auto-sizing the summary table, selecting first sheet each time the code is run and so on.
I found another way to do this database managemnent by using a 'Do Loop'. Cite: EverydayVBA from Youtube 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piiDC4TQ1KE'
I had much help from searching various github repos and finding

As was mentioned in this Data Science program opening, using google-fu is crucial in learning programing
or programming in general. The truth is, the code is out there. Even though I was able to find the code
while searching for help, I have gone through this code step by step to understand
It's actions. This project was tough for me and I couldn't have done it without google-fu and all
our in-class activites + office hours....

I ran into a Run-Time Error 6 code. Overflow.
I fixed this by Dim Total_Ticker_Volume As Variant *instead of Double. This may be a mac specific issue.
